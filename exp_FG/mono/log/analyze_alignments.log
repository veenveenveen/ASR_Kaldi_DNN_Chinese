The optional-silence phone sil occupies 3.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 80.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 2.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.4 hours of data, or 0.4 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 3.9% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (7,9.4,24)
